#  Predicting Failures in Industrial Compressor-Based Machines
My thesis is about predicting failures in industrial compressor-based machines by varying the prediction and the reading window sizes.
The repository contains three real datasets and their experiments into three distinct folders:
* Wrapper Machine
* Blood Refrigerator
* Nitrogen Generator
